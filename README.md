JEQL
====
JEQL is a scripting language for spatial processing and ETL, which runs on the JVM.  

JEQL is based on the standard and well-known SQL model.  This enables declarative specification of data query and transformation.

JEQL improves on SQL syntax & semantics by adding:

* a streaming model of computation
* factoring of complex SQL queries into a chain of simpler queries
* factoring out and naming common subexpressions
* adding SPLIT BY as the the inverse of GROUP BY
 
JEQL provides an extensive set of commands and functions.

Built-in commands include:

* Readers and Writers for many textual and spatial formats
 
Built-in function libraries include:

* geometry manipulation
* String manipulation
* RegEX matching and extracting
