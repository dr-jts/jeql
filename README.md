JEQL
====
A scripting language for spatial processing and ETL, which runs on the JVM.  

JEQL is based on the standard and well-known SQL model.  This enables declarative specification of data query and transformation.

JEQL improves on SQL syntax & semantics by adding:

* a streaming model of computation
* factoring of complex SQL queries into a chain of simpler queries
* factoring out and naming common subexpressions
* adding SPLIT BY as the the inverse of GROUP BY
 
JEQL provides an extensive set of commands and functions, including:

* Readers and Writers for many textual and spatial formats
* functions for geometry manipulation
* functions for String manipulation, including RegEX processing
