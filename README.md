JEQL
====
A scripting language for spatial processing and ETL.  JEQL is based on the SQL model for declarative specification of data query and transformation.  It adds:

* many functions for geometry manipulation
* a streaming model of computation
* this enables factoring complex SQL queries into a chain of simpler queries
