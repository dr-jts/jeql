JEQL
====
A scripting language for spatial processing and ETL, which runs on the JVM.  

JEQL is based on the standard and well-known SQL model for declarative specification of data query and transformation.

JEQL improves SQL syntax & semantics by adding:

* a streaming model of computation
* allows factoring complex SQL queries into a chain of simpler queries
* common subexpressions can be factored out and named
* SPLIT BY provides the inverse of GROUP BY
 
JEQL provides an extensive set of commands and functions, including:

* Readers and Writers for many textual and spatial formats
* functions for geometry manipulation
* functions for String manipulation, including RegEX processing
