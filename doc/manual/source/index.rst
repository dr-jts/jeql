JEQL Query Language
===================

The JEQL Query Language is a language which supports processing tabular data structures.

The 'E' in JEQL stands for all of the following:

* **Extended** - JEQL provides extensions to SQL to make it more powerful for processing data
* **Embeddable** - The JEQL engine can be embedded in other applications to provide a query language for table-oriented data models
* **ETL** - Extract/Transform/Load is a major use case for JEQL
* **Efficient** - JEQL's implementation makes development and execution faster!
